      <h2 class="sub-heading">Me</h2>
      <p>I'm Jen! I live in Cardiff and grew up in Gloucestershire. I love exploring new places, 
        and going to gigs and festivals. I like to keep active, mainly by going on walks and doing yoga. 
        I also enjoy relaxing at home with a good book or Netflix series.

    <section class="about-item about-item-how">
      <h2 class="sub-heading">How I got into coding</h2>
      <p>My first experience of coding was in A Level ICT, where I learned some basic html. Years later
        I put some of that knowledge to use when I set up a blog through Blogspot, to document my
        study year in Malta. I quickly realised that I enjoyed playing around with the design much 
        more than writing posts.
      </p>
      <p>Then, in my final year of BSc Business Maths, my dissertation involved learning
        Python to create programs that calculated financial equations based on parameters inputted
        by the user. At first I didn't really get it, then one day it just clicked. Shortly after, a past
        graduate gave a lecture about his job as a software developer, which really resonated with me. 
        It was the first time I understood how I could build a career out of my love for problem 
        solving.
